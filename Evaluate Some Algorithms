Now it is time to create some models of the data and estimate their accuracy on unseen data.\

Here is what we are going to cover in this step:
Separate out a validation dataset.
Set-up the test harness to use 10-fold cross validation.
Build 5 different models to predict species from flower measurements
Select the best model.
