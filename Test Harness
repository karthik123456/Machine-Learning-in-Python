We will use 10-fold cross validation to estimate accuracy.

This will split our dataset into 10 parts, train on 9 and test on 1 and repeat for all combinations of train-test splits.

We are using the metric of ‘accuracy‘ to evaluate models. This is a ratio of the number of correctly predicted instances in divided by the total number of instances in the dataset multiplied by 100 to give a percentage (e.g. 95% accurate). We will be using the
