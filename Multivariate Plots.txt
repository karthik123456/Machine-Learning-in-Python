Now we can look at the interactions between the variables.

First, let’s look at scatterplots of all pairs of attributes. This can be helpful to spot structured relationships between input variables.

# scatter plot matrix
scatter_matrix(dataset)
plt.show()

Note the diagonal grouping of some pairs of attributes. This suggests a high correlation and a predictable relationship.
