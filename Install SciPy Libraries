This tutorial assumes Python version 2.7 or 3.5.

There are 5 key libraries that you will need to install. Below is a list of the Python SciPy libraries required for this tutorial:

scipy
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
sklearn
There are many ways to install these libraries. My best advice is to pick one method then be consistent in installing each library.

The scipy installation page provides excellent instructions for installing the above libraries on multiple different platforms, such as Linux, mac OS X and Windows. If you have any doubts or questions, refer to this guide, it has been followed by thousands of people.

On Mac OS X, you can use macports to install Python 2.7 and these libraries. For more information on macports, see the homepage.
On Linux you can use your package manager, such as yum on Fedora to install RPMs.
If you are on Windows or you are not confident, I would recommend installing the free version of Anaconda that includes everything you need.

Note: This tutorial assumes you have scikit-learn version 0.18 or higher installed.
